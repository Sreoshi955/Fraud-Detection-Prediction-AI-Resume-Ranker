AI Resume Ranker â€” Flask Web App

An AI-powered web application to automatically rank resumes against a given job description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Built with a clean and intuitive Flask-based interface, this tool streamlines resume screening and helps recruiters and hiring managers shortlist candidates efficiently.

Features

ðŸ”¹ Extracts and processes resume content (PDFs) using PyMuPDF
ðŸ”¹ Compares resumes against a provided job description using TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity.
ðŸ”¹ Ranks candidates based on relevance scores
ðŸ”¹ Generates a downloadable CSV report for easy review
ðŸ”¹ Sleek and responsive web interface (Flask + HTML) for uploading resumes and entering job descriptions
ðŸ”¹ Secure and easy-to-use, designed for real-world usage in HRTech and recruitment automation
